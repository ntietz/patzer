## Dependencies

Since we're using [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui), we have some dependencies to install before the GUI will run.

On Fedora, run:

```
sudo dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra speech-dispatcher-devel libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel cmake fontconfig-devel
```
